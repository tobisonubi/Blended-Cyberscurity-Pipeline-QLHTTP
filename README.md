## Portfolio
> Some of my documents are in PDF format to accommodate advanced formatting, include colorful presentations, and incorporate abundant screenshots for enhanced clarity and detail.

I have developed a cybersecurity portfolio showcasing various tasks and projects completed during my journey to earn the Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. This program has provided insights into:
* Programming for cybersecurity tasks
* Frameworks and controls that inform security operations
* SIEM tools for cybersecurity
* Detecting and responding to incidents using an intrusion detection system
* Performing packet capture and analysis

### Tools 
Several tools that I used: 
* Google Workspace (Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides)
* Markdown Language 
* Tcpdump
* Wireshark
* Linux OS
* SQL
* Chronicle
* Splunk
* Suricata
* Python 


**Stay tuned for updates!**

This portfolio will continuously grow as I complete more certificates and projects. I encourage you to visit again to see my progress and learn more about my skills and experience.
